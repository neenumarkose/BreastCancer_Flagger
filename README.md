# BreastCancer_Flagger

## About the Project

Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, representing the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a significant public health problem in todayâ€™s society. This project is implemented to find out the cancer type using the Wisconsin dataset. We are implementing logistic, svm and naive bayes models here. This analysis aims to observe which features are most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer and to see general trends that may aid us in model selection and hyper parameter selection. The goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant. To achieve this i have used machine learning classification methods to fit a function that can predict the discrete class of new input.

## Dataset


Dataset link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic)

Attribute Information:

ID number
Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3-32)
Ten real-valued features ar@e computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) c) perimeter d) area e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) i) symmetry j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)


## Build with 

We used python to implement the projet and available in .ipynb files.
The model is saved as pickle file and available as .pkl

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

We will use the UCI Machine Learning Repository for breast cancer dataset.
Download flasgger to the local machine.

### Models
Logistic Regression

### How to use it.
Download the classifier.pkl file for the saved model.
Dowload Flagger API.py file for the flagger code.
